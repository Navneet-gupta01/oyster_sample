# Oyster Application

## To Start the console Application
```
sbt run
```
and follow the instruction.


## Further Improvement:
1.	Error handling can be improved.
2. 	Refactor Some code to make it more generic.
3. 	Some Edge cases missing , for Ex: User touching multiple time at same station within short span of time while system still processing, they should not be charged more than once.  
4.	For now not storing journey history as not required. Can be incooperated further into the solution.
